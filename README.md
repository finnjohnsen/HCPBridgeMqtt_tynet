# Buy a ready to use PCB on [shop.tynet.eu](https://shop.tynet.eu/rs485-bridge-diy-hoermann-mqtt-adapter-esp32-s3-dev-board) :rocket:

If you use a PCB from us, you can get started with our instructions: [Getting started with tynet.eu PCBs](https://github.com/Tysonpower/HCPBridgeMqtt_tynet/wiki)

Would you like to use our ESPHome-based firmware, which offers a few advantages? See our guide: [Getting started with ESPHome](https://github.com/Tysonpower/HCPBridgeMqtt_tynet/wiki/Upgrade-Firmware)

You can find prebuild firmware for our boards in the Firmware folder as non-ESPHome as well as ESPHome version.

# Hörmann HCPBridge for Home Assistant

This repository includes firmware that emulates the Hörmann UAP1-HCP board (Series 4 motors) as well as the older UAP1 that is used for Series 3 motors.
It uses a ESP32 with a RS485 converter and exposes garage door controls over a web page as well as Home Assistant (directly or MQTT).

<br>

## Firmware Options

All firmware is optimised for our boards, but it can be used with self build hardware as well with minimal modifications.

<br>

### Arduino based Firmware - Series 4 only

Based on a fork of [Gifford47's](https://github.com/Gifford47/HCPBridgeMqtt) and other peoples work it offers a good MQTT based solution with a nice WEB UI and auto discovery for Home Assistant.

This is the default Series 4 firmware for our boards and can also be used with other smart home systems as long as they support MQTT.

<br>

### ESPHome based Firmware

Based on a fork of [14yannick's](https://github.com/14yannick/esphome-hcpbridge) and other peoples work it is the best Solution if you use Home Assistant as it directly uses their API and doesen't need MQTT.

Setup is really quick and the Firmware is more stable thanks to ESPome at it's core. Changing the FIrmware or adding Sensors is also simple using the yaml config and recompiling it in ESPHome.
There are two different versions, one for Series 4 and one for Series 3 boards. For this reason we ship our Series 3 boards with the ESPHome based Firmware.
If you don't use Home Assistant you can modify the yaml configuration to use MQTT as well - but you need to compile the firmware yourself to add your credentials.

<br>

## Features
- Read door status: open/closed/position, light on/off  
- Control: open, close, stop, light toggle, set position (half/vent/custom)  
- MQTT with Home Assistant Auto Discovery  
- Web Interface for configuration & control  
- OTA Updates  
- First-use hotspot (for out-of-the-box Wi-Fi setup) 
- Connects to the strongest AP if the SSID is broadcast by several access points
- Optional external sensors (DS18x20, BME280, DHT22, HC-SR04, HC-SR501, MQ4)
- Efficient MQTT traffic (only publish on state change)  
- Support multiple HCP Bridges for multiple garage doors (one bridge per motor)
- Support for ESP32-S3
- BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) door control with per-user PIN authentication  

<br>

## Web UI (Arduino based Firmware)

You can use the WebUI for configuration and control of the garage door under.

***http://[deviceip]***

<img width="632" height="790" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a3b047f2-63ca-4785-bbc7-5dc1dd7dba2c" />

<br>

## Wi-Fi in multi-AP networks

If the same SSID is broadcast by several access points (UniFi, mesh, repeaters), leave **Connect to strongest AP** enabled in the basic configuration (default: on). The device then scans all channels and associates with the AP with the best signal, instead of the first one it happens to find. Without it the bridge can stay attached to a far AP at a very weak signal and re-attach to that same AP after every reconnect, so it cannot be moved from the network side.

Turn it off to get the slightly faster (but signal-agnostic) fast scan on single-AP networks.

For the ESPHome based firmware the equivalent is `fast_connect: false` in the `wifi:` block (the default).

<br>

## BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) Door Control

The firmware includes a BLE server that allows you to control your garage door from a phone or computer using Bluetooth Low Energy. BLE control requires PIN authentication and includes security features like lockout after failed attempts.

### Connecting

The device advertises on BLE using the same name as the **hostname** set in Basic Configuration (default: **HCPBRIDGE**). You can connect using:
- Any BLE scanner app (nRF Connect, LightBlue, etc.)
- A Web Bluetooth API page (Chrome/Edge)
- A custom mobile app

### Authentication

Before sending commands, authenticate by writing JSON to the **AUTH** characteristic:

```json
{"user": "A", "pin": "your-pin"}
```

After authentication, the **STATUS** characteristic includes `"auth": true` in notifications.

### Characteristics

| Characteristic | UUID Suffix | Property | Usage |
|---------------|-------------|----------|-------|
| OPEN | `...5c70` | WRITE | Write any byte to open the door |
| CLOSE | `...5c71` | WRITE | Write any byte to close the door |
| STOP | `...5c72` | WRITE | Write any byte to stop the door |
| TOGGLE | `...5c73` | WRITE | Write any byte to toggle the door |
| STATUS | `...5c74` | NOTIFY | Pushes door state as JSON with auth status |
| AUTH | `...5c75` | WRITE | Write `{"user":"A","pin":"..."}` to authenticate |

**Service UUID:** `fb0a5c8e-9d21-4b6a-8c3f-1e7a0d4b5c6f`

### Security Features

- **Per-user PINs** — 8 users (A–H), each with a unique PIN
- **SHA-256 + salt** — PINs stored as salted hashes, never in plain text
- **Lockout** — 5 failed attempts triggers a 30-minute lockout
- **Per-connection auth** — each new connection requires fresh authentication
- **Audit log** — 100 entries of who did what, stored on device

### Managing Users via Web UI

Connect to the device's WiFi (HCPBRIDGE) and visit `http://192.168.4.1`, then use the API endpoints:

**List users:**
```
GET /bleusers
```

**Change a PIN:**
```
POST /bleuser
{"action": "setPin", "userId": "A", "pin": "newpin123"}
```

**Enable/disable a user:**
```
POST /bleuser
{"action": "toggle", "userId": "B"}
```

**View audit log:**
```
GET /blelog
```

**Clear audit log:**
```
POST /blelog
```

 <summary>Step 1: Wiring</summary>

  ## Wiring
 
 ![min wiring](docs/Images/esp32.png)
 
 ESP32 powering requires a Step Down Module such as LM2596S DC-DC, but any 24VDC ==> 5VDC will do, even the tiny ones with 3 pin.
 Please note that the suggested serial pins for serial interfacing, on ESP32, are 16 RXD and 17 TXD.
 
 
 <details>
 <summary>It is possible to implement it with protoboard and underside soldering:</summary>

 </details>
 
 <details>
 <summary>Details specific to Az-delivery ESP32 (ESP32-WROOM-32)</summary>
 Note the pinout on this cheap but widespread ESP32 module is a bit different. The GND on the bottom left must not be used (it is actually wrongly labeled, it should be CMD). Use the top right instead. Moreover, use the pin 16 as RXD and pin 17 as TXD to match the code on this repository (using UART2, not UART0).

<details>
 <summary>Step 2: Firmware upload</summary>
 
 ## Upload the firmware

### Option A: Flash via CLI (recommended)

Requires [`esptool`](https://github.com/espressif/esptool) installed (`pip3 install esptool`). Connect the ESP32-S3 via USB and run:

```bash
esptool --chip esp32s3 --port /dev/ttyACM0 --baud 460800 write_flash 0x0 HCP_Tynet_merged.bin
```

- Replace `/dev/ttyACM0` with your serial port (`/dev/ttyUSB0`, `COM3`, etc.)
- The merged binary is produced by PlatformIO at `HCPBridgeESP32/.pio/build/HCP_Tynet/HCP_Tynet_merged.bin` or in `HCPBridgeESP32/fw/HCP_Tynet_merged.bin`
- On first boot the device creates a WiFi hotspot (**HCPBRIDGE**) for initial configuration

### Option B: Build and flash with PlatformIO

```bash
cd HCPBridgeESP32
pio run -e HCP_Tynet          # build
pio run -e HCP_Tynet -t upload # build + flash
```

Set the upload port in `platformio.ini` if not `/dev/ttyACM0`:
```ini
[env:HCP_Tynet]
upload_port = /dev/ttyUSB0
```

### Sensors
 
 To use additional sensors, you have also to build and upload the according firmware for the sensor. See [flash instructions](docs/flashing_instructions.md) for further info.

 <summary>HC-SR04 Ultra sonic proximity sensor</summary>
 
 <br>
 Use the project task for HC-SR04.
 The wiring pins are:<br>
 SR04 Trigger pin is connected to GPIO5<br>
 SR04 ECHO pin is connected to GPIO18<br><br>
 
 It will send an MQTT discovery for two sensor one for the distance in cm available below the sensor and the other informing if the car park is available. It compares if the distance below is less than the maximal measured distance then car park is not available. The hcsr04_maxdistanceCm is defined with 150cm in configuration.h. This setting might not work for everyone. Change it to your needs.
 
 </details>
</details><br>

<details>
  <summary>Step 3: Configuration</summary>

  ## Configuration
  At first boot the settings from the `configuration.h` file are taken over as user preferences. If you choose to make your own build you can set up your settings there.
  After first boot you can change your settings directly in the Web UI without the need to create a new build. 
  
  With the default configuration it will open a Wi-Fi Hotspot you can connect to. When connected to it, you can use the URL http://192.168.4.1 in a web browser to access the Web UI and configure the device.
  
  Use the "Basic Configuration" section to set your Wi-Fi and MQTT credentials, after hitting the Save button your device will reboot.
  The password fields are redacted if there are set with a *. If you don't want to change it, just leave the * as it will be interpreted as unchanged.

  The preferences will stay even after an OTA update.
  When the memory of your ESP gets deleted your ESP will again load the settings from the configuration.h file.
  
  **Reset methods** (see section [Reset and Wipe Data](#reset-and-wipe-data) below)
</details><br>

<details>
  <summary>Step 4: Installation and bus scan</summary>
 
  ## Installation
  
  * Connect the board to the BUS
  * Run a BUS scan (differs on the following hardware version): 
  
  ### Old hardware version
  
  BUS scan is started through flipping (ON - OFF) last dip switch. Note that BUS power (+24v) is removed when no devices are detected. In case of issues, you may find useful to "jump start" the device using the +24V provision of other connectors of the motor control board.
    
  ### New hardware version 
  With newer HW versions, the bus scan is carried out using the LC display in menu 37. For more see: [SupraMatic 4 Busscan](https://www.tor7.de/news/bus-scan-beim-supramatic-serie-4-fehlercode-04-vermeiden)

</details><br>

## Reset and Wipe Data

There are multiple ways to reset the device to factory defaults or wipe specific data without reflashing.

### Method 1: BOOT Button (5 quick presses)

Press the **BOOT** button on the ESP32 **5 times** within a **6-second window**. This triggers a full preference reset and the device reboots.

- All WiFi credentials, MQTT settings, and sensor configuration are erased
- BLE user data (PINs, audit log) is **preserved** (stored in a separate NVS namespace)
- Device loads default settings from the firmware's `configuration.h`

### Method 2: HTTP Endpoint

If you can reach the device on your network:

```
GET http://[deviceip]/reset
```

This clears the main preferences (WiFi, MQTT, sensors) and reboots. Same effect as the BOOT button method above. BLE user data is preserved.

### Method 3: Wipe All Data (Full Factory Reset)

To wipe **everything** (including BLE users, audit log, and bonded devices):

```bash
esptool --chip esp32s3 --port /dev/ttyACM0 erase_flash
```

Then reflash the firmware:

```bash
esptool --chip esp32s3 --port /dev/ttyACM0 --baud 460800 write_flash 0x0 HCP_Tynet_merged.bin
```

Replace `/dev/ttyACM0` with your device's serial port (e.g., `/dev/ttyUSB0` on Linux, `COM3` on Windows).

### Disable Sensors Only (3 quick presses)

Press the **BOOT** button **3 times** within a **6-second window**. This disables all external sensors and reboots — useful if a sensor is causing crashes. WiFi/MQTT/BLE settings remain intact.

### Reset BLE Lockout

If the BLE service is locked out (5 failed attempts):

- Wait 30 minutes for the lockout to expire automatically
- Or use the Web UI to change a user's PIN, which resets the lockout counter
- Or use `GET http://[deviceip]/bleusers` to check remaining lockout time

### What Gets Reset

| Action | WiFi/MQTT | BLE Users | BLE Audit Log | Sensors |
|--------|-----------|-----------|---------------|---------|
| 5x BOOT press | Reset | Kept | Kept | Reset |
| 3x BOOT press | Kept | Kept | Kept | Disabled |
| HTTP `/reset` | Reset | Kept | Kept | Reset |
| `erase_flash` | Reset | Reset | Reset | Reset |
| POST `/blelog` | Kept | Kept | Cleared | Kept |

## Set the ventilation position 

This is just a quick and dirty implementation and needs refactoring, but it is working.
Using the Shutter Custom Card (from HACS) it is also possible to get a representation of the current position of the door, and slide it to custom position (through set_position MQTT command).

The switch for the venting position works with a small hack. Based on the analyses of dupas.me the motor should gave a status 0x0A in venting position. As this was not the case the variable VENT_POS in hciemulator.h was default with value '0x08' which correspond to the position when the garage door is in venting position (position available under ***http://[deviceip]/status***). When the door is stopped in this position the doorstate is set as venting.
